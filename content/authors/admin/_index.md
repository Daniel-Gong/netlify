Dongyu Gong is an undergraduate student of Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University. His research focuses on visual attention. Specifically, he is interested in how distractors capture our attention during visual search and how our visual system learns to suppress salient distractors. Dongyu is currently a member of cognitive neuroscience lab which is led by Pei Sun, Associate Professor of Department of Psychology.

During his leisure time, Dongyu likes to watch science fictions (He loves The **Three Body Problem** most, and he really admires the author Liu Cixin). Dongyu loves to play tennis, although he is not very professional. He loves soft music, especially piano music.
